# Stock-Portfolio-Optimization
📈 Overview

Investing in the stock market can be intimidating for beginners, with an overwhelming array of choices and the challenge of balancing risk and return. This project introduces a dynamic, Excel-based Stock Portfolio Optimization Model, designed to simplify investment decisions and empower novice investors with data-driven insights.
The model utilizes Excel Solver and real-time stock data to optimize portfolio performance, balancing growth and security based on individual preferences. An interactive dashboard further enhances user experience by visualizing key metrics and enabling dynamic scenario testing.
