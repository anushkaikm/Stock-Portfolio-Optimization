# Stock Portfolio Optimization Model: Empowering Beginner Investors

### 📈 **Overview**  
Investing in the stock market can be intimidating for beginners, with an overwhelming array of choices and the challenge of balancing risk and return. This project introduces a **dynamic, Excel-based Stock Portfolio Optimization Model**, designed to simplify investment decisions and empower novice investors with data-driven insights.  

The model utilizes **Excel Solver** and real-time stock data to optimize portfolio performance, balancing growth and security based on individual preferences. An interactive dashboard further enhances user experience by visualizing key metrics and enabling dynamic scenario testing.

### 💡 **Features**  
- **Dynamic Portfolio Optimization**: Generates risk-adjusted stock allocations using historical data.  
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Utilizes Excel’s STOCKHISTORY function to fetch five years of monthly stock prices.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes portfolio performance, risk-return trade-offs, and scenario outcomes.  
- **Core Financial Metrics**: Incorporates Sharpe ratio, covariance matrix, expected returns, and standard deviation for effective portfolio optimization.  
- **Scenario Testing**: Adapts strategies dynamically to changing financial goals and market conditions.
